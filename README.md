# browser-update
Many internet users are still using very old, out-dated browsers â€“ most of them for no actual reason. 
We want to remind these unobtrusively to update their browser.

## Goals
1. Provide webdesigners a unified way to tell the user that they need a newer browser to use this website in all its beauty.
2. Improve the security, comfort and overall experiance of users by convincing them to update
3. But: do not annoy or lock out users

## How to use
Go to [browser-update.org](http://browser-update.org), choose the browsers you want to be notified and embed the code into your website.

Or use the npm package:

## npm usage
Install it:

    npm install mq-js --save

And load it:

````js
var browserUpdate = require('browser-update');

browserUpdate({ [configuration-options] })
````

or

````js
import browserUpdate from 'browser-update';

browserUpdate({ [configuration-options] })
````

Options are documented [here](http://browser-update.org/customize.html)

## Unobtrusive
Unobtrusive here means:
* We take care not to  erroneously notify users by constantly tweaking the detection code
* users of small niche browsers are not notified, users who have no possibility to update are not notified
* We do not block the users form using a website in any way
* The website can be used without any additional step
* The notification will only appear once a day by default
* If the user **activly** closes the notification, it will reappear after a week


## More features
* Translated into >30 languages
* Giving users reasons why an [up-to-date browser is important](http://browser-update.org/update.html)
* Only showing browsers that are available for the users operating system.
